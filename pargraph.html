            This paragraph has multiple
            <br/>lines. But HTML reduces them
            <br/>to a single line, omitting
            <br/>the carriage return we have used.

            This     paragraph has multiple
            spaces. But     it is displayed 
            as it is    unlike the paragraph 
                 tag.
